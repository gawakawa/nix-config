This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Problem-Solving Approach

**CRITICAL**: Always follow this order when debugging:

1. **Understand the current state** - Gather facts about what is actually happening
2. **Identify the root cause** - Analyze the facts to determine why it's happening
3. **Propose solutions** - Only after understanding the cause, suggest fixes

**Never jump to solutions before understanding the problem**. Speculation without evidence leads to wrong fixes.
